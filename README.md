# Algorithms

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of decision-making and classification models, beginning with simple heuristics and progressing toward more complex algorithms, with an emphasis on understanding their underlying assumptions.

## Models

### The Minimalist (`The_Minimalist.r`)
A fast-and-frugal **heuristic** that makes decisions using a single, randomly sampled cue, stopping at the first feature that discriminates between two options. The model assumes equal cue importance, ignores magnitude of differences, and relies on minimal information and computation.
